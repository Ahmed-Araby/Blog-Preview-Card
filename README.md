## My process
- learning about variable fonts
- reflect the design system into my style sheet using css variables and classes.
- set global styles.
- define the HTML structure and assign classes.
- style for mobile screens (mobile first approach).
- style for desktop screens.
- document.

### concepts

- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS custom variables
- Flexbox
- media queries


### What I learned
* the difference between variables fonts and static fonts.
* loading custom fonts
* style using mobile first workflow. (smaller screens first then move up. this helps with defining the media query break points)
* using media queries
